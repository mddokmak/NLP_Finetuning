Which of the following is true?\n\t\t            ReLU(x) = max\\{x, 0\\} \\\n\t\t            Sigmoid(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n                    ?\n\nOptions:\nA. $C_{g, \frac{1}{2}}$ may have an accuracy significantly lower than $C_{f, \frac{1}{2}}$ on $T$\nB. $C_{h, 0}$ may have an accuracy significantly lower than $C_{f, \frac{1}{2}}$ on $T$\nC. $C_{q, 0}$ may have an accuracy significantly lower than $C_{f, \frac{1}{2}}$ on $T$\nD. $C_{g, \frac{1}{2}}$, $C_{h, 0}$, and $C_{q, 0}$ have the same accuracy as  $C_{f, \frac{1}{2}}$ on $T$\n\nAnswer:","answer":"B"}
